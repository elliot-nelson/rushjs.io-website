## TreeNode type

Indicates the tree-like data structure that [TreePattern](./tree-pattern.treepattern.md) will traverse.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type TreeNode = any;
```

## Remarks

Since `TreePattern` makes relatively few assumptions object the object structure, this is just an alias for `any` .
